# javascript-blackjack-game

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of the popular card game, Blackjack.
The game is built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, and is designed to be played in the browser.
The game includes a basic UI that displays the dealer's and player's cards, and allows the player to hit or stand during their turn. The game follows standard Blackjack rules, with the dealer hitting until their hand reaches a score of 17 or higher, and the player winning if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's. The code is well-organized and commented to make it easy for developers to understand and modify the game.

This project is a great starting point for those looking to learn JavaScript or build their own browser-based card game.
